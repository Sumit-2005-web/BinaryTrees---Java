## ðŸ“– Introduction

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children: left and right. It is widely used in coding interviews and system design.

## ðŸŒ± Tree Construction

- Creating nodes using a class `Node`
- Building tree manually or using array input
- Recursive tree builders

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
